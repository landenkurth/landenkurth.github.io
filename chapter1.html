    <h1>why i ;ike to go swimming in the summer</h1>
    <p>swimming is my favorite activity in the summer
        when the sun is shinning the air is warm you will find me dipping in my back yard pool
 its not an impressive pool only three feet deep but its mine   </p>
 <p>but there are three reasons i like to swim</p>
 <ul>
    <li>i get lots of exercise</li>
    <li>i enjoy the freedom</li>
    <l1>i have an opportunity to be in the sun</l1>
 </ul>
